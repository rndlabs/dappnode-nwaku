  - title: Network
    id: network
    description: >-
      By default waku will connect to the `wakuv2.prod` network. This is the main network for waku. You can also connect to the `wakuv2.test` network
      which is a test network for waku. Additionally, status run their own networks as well that you may connect to.

  - title: PubSub Topic
    id: pubsub-topic
    description: >-
      By default in this package, nwaku will subscribe to the `/waku/2/dev-waku/proto` topic. This topic is designed for development purposes and 
      should have lower bandwidth requirements than nwaku's default topic (though there are **no guarantees** that this is the case). If you wish to
      subscribe nwaku's default topic, set this to an empty string. If you wish to subscribe to a different topic, specify it here, or specify multiple
      topics separated by space/s.

  - title: Privacy settings
    id: privacy
    description: >-
      Waku is designed to be a privacy-preserving protocol. The user can selectively enable privacy features. On dappnode, by 
      default a custom level of privacy is enabled (notably the `agent-string` is set to `nwaku_on_dappnode`).

      The `paranoid` level of privacy will disable the `agent-string` and will randomize the node address each time it starts. 
      The `paranoid` level of privacy is recommended for users who wish to maximize their privacy.
    target:
      type: environment
      name: PRIVACY
      service: nwaku
    required: true
    enum:
      - "paranoid"

  - title: Agent name
    id: agent-name
    description: >-
      By default this dappnode package will set the agent name to `nwaku_on_dappnode`. This allows other nodes on the network to identify this 
      node as a dappnode node running waku. If you wish to use a different name, specify it here. Optionally, you can set the default nwaku
      agent name setting this to an empty string (the ndoe will present itself with the agent name `nwaku`).

  - title: Randomize node adddress
    id: randomize-address
    description: >-
      By default, waku randomly generates a different address each time it starts. This is done for privacy reasons. Should you wish to
      maintain a consistent address, disable this feature by selecting false.
